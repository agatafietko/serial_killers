# Serial Killers Analysis

This project analyzes the "Serial Killers Dataset" from Kaggle to visualize and understand patterns related to serial killers across different regions.

## Project Overview

This analysis examines historical data on serial killers to identify patterns and trends in their activities. The Jupyter notebook includes detailed code, explanations, and visualizations that provide insights into this sensitive subject matter from an academic perspective.

**Disclaimer**: This analysis is purely for academic and educational purposes. The subject matter is sensitive, and the data is presented objectively without any intent to glorify or sensationalize crime.

## Interactive Notebook

The `serial_killers_analysis.ipynb` notebook contains all the code and fully rendered visualizations. You can view this notebook directly on GitHub to see all the charts and analysis without having to run any code. The notebook features:

- Markdown explanations before each section
- Comments throughout the code
- All visualizations rendered inline
- A cohesive cool/dark color scheme appropriate for the subject matter
- Professional presentation of sensitive data

## Analyses Performed

1. **Top 10 Most Deadly Serial Killers**: Visualization of serial killers with the highest number of proven victims.
2. **Top 5 Serial Killers in the US**: Visualization focusing on the deadliest serial killers in the United States.
3. **Top 5 Countries with Serial Killers**: Visualization showing which countries have the highest counts of serial killers.
4. **Victims by Decade**: Analysis of how the number of serial killer victims has changed over different decades.
5. **Killing Methods Distribution**: Examination of the most common methods used by serial killers.
6. **Age at First Kill Distribution**: Analysis of the age distribution when serial killers committed their first murder.

## Key Visualizations

All visualizations are rendered directly in the notebook and feature:

- **Cohesive cool/dark color scheme**: Carefully selected colors for appropriate representation of the subject matter
- **Clear data presentation**: Focused on factual representation without sensationalism
- **Consistent styling**: Professional appearance across all visualizations
- **Thoughtful design**: Color choices and layouts that respect the sensitivity of the subject
- **Improved readability**: Enhanced contrast and annotations for better interpretation

The main visualizations include:
- `top10_deadliest_killers.png`: Bar chart of serial killers with the most victims
- `top5_us_killers.png`: Bar chart of the deadliest serial killers in the US
- `top5_countries.png`: Pie chart of countries with the most serial killers
- `victims_by_decade.png`: Line chart showing trends in victim counts across decades
- `methods_distribution.png`: Bar chart of the most common killing methods
- `age_distribution.png`: Histogram showing the age distribution at first kill

## Key Findings

- Harold Shipman (UK) and Luis Garavito (Colombia) stand out with the highest number of proven victims
- Within the US, Gary Ridgway, John Wayne Gacy, and Ted Bundy are among the most deadly serial killers
- The United States has the highest number of documented serial killers in the dataset
- The 1970s appears to be the decade with the highest number of serial killer victims
- Shooting and strangulation are the most common methods used by serial killers
- Most serial killers in the dataset committed their first murder between the ages of 25-35
